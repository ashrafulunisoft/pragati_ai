Perfect — now I understand your goal clearly: **short timeline + publish current system (novelty focused, minimal evaluation)**.

Let’s break it down realistically:

---

# 🧠 Current Status Recap

✔ MCP-based AI login security system
✔ Hybrid rule + AI (Redis counters + MiniMax)
✔ JSON-based AI decision (SAFE / MALICIOUS + attack type + risk score)
✔ Event-driven email alert
✔ Separate security log file
✔ Research novelty is **high** (MCP protocol + AI-driven intrusion classification + structured logs)
❌ No heavy dataset evaluation
❌ No statistical analysis
❌ No formal mathematical model

# 📊 Publication Recommendation

## 1️⃣ Journal vs Conference

| Type                                                    | Pros                                                                      | Cons                                              | Timeline                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Journal (Q3/Q4)**                                     | Peer-reviewed, more prestige, DOI, long-lasting                           | Takes months, minor revisions can delay           | 3–6 months typical for Q3/Q4 |
| **Conference (Applied / CS Security / AI Conferences)** | Fast review (1–2 months), quick publication, good for prototype & novelty | Less depth, lower prestige, sometimes short paper | 1–3 months typical           |
| **Q1/Q2 Journal**                                       | Top-tier recognition                                                      | Need dataset, metrics, math, evaluation           | 6–12 months+                 |

## 2️⃣ Suggested Approach for **Short Time Publication**

### 🔹 Go for **Conference Paper** first

**Why:**

* Prototype + architecture + novelty = perfect fit
* No need dataset-heavy evaluation for applied CS/AI conference
* Review cycle fast → 1–2 months
* Quick publication + DOI → you can cite it later
* Good for research track, then extend for journal later

### 🔹 Recommended Conferences (CS / AI / Cybersecurity)

| Conference                                 | Notes                          | Timeline   | Level |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------- | ----- |
| IEEE ICAC/ICSS / ICS2 / ARES               | Applied security + AI          | 1–3 months | Q3/Q4 |
| ACM SAC (Special Session on Security & AI) | Prototype + novelty            | 2 months   | Q3    |
| IEEE INDIN / ICIEA                         | Intelligent systems + security | 1–2 months | Q3/Q4 |
| Workshops / AI + Security Track            | Prototype + AI-driven login    | 1 month    | Fast  |

> Focus: **Applied AI Security + Novel MCP + JSON Decision + Event-driven Email**

## 3️⃣ Quick Tips for Short Publication

1. **Title:** Highlight novelty

   ```txt
   "MCP-Based AI-Driven Adaptive Authentication Security with Structured Decision Protocol"
   ```
2. **Abstract:** Focus on:

   * Hybrid AI + rule approach
   * MCP novelty
   * Real-time JSON decision
   * Event-driven email alert
   * Research reproducibility
3. **Contribution Section:**

   * MCP protocol
   * Structured JSON decision
   * Hybrid adaptive authentication
   * Email alert + log system
4. **Evaluation Section:**

   * Simple simulated login attempts (realistic)
   * Show some statistics: attempts vs MALICIOUS / SAFE counts
   * Even small table works (no big dataset needed)
5. **Figures:**

   * Architecture diagram
   * Event flow diagram
   * MCP JSON decision example

---

## 4️⃣ Optional: Q3 Journal Later

After conference publication:

* Extend paper with:

  * Metrics, dataset simulation
  * Risk scoring model
  * Explainable AI / SHAP
  * Threat taxonomy
* Submit to **Q3/Q2 journal** for full-length paper

---

# 🎯 Summary Recommendation

**For short period publication:**

✅ Target **applied CS / AI security conference**
✅ Highlight MCP novelty, AI hybrid system, structured logs, email alert
✅ Minimal evaluation (simulated logins) enough
✅ Conference → fast DOI → can later extend to journal

**Next step (if you want):**
I can **draft a full conference paper outline + sections + figures + table plan** based on your current system — ready for submission within **1–2 weeks**.

Do you want me to do that?
